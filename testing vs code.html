        <h1> Welcome to my first weg pag har har </h1>
        <p> This is my 3rd attempt using vs code to get this test web page to work because TextEdit looks ugly on mac os and according to the internet VS Code is a good app to use to write code. </p>
        <h2>Why it took me three attempts to get my webpage to work</h2>
        <p>SOOO... everything with my code seemed fine, the problem was when I saved it and tried to open it in the browser the page was blank. While trouble shooting thew problem I solved it by clicking "save as", "document name.html", format= all file types. When I did that the "open edittor" drop down popped up with my file name and boom boom bam, my code open in the browser. Really not sure why buttttttttt it works.</p>
        <h3> Why my h2 paragraph is longer than it needs to be </h3>
        <p> The last h2 paragraph was a simple test really. I was seeing if i kept typeing my paragrapgh longer and longer horizontrally in VS Code what the outcome would be. Personally I didnt know if I would have to press "enter" to make the paragrapgh shift below if that makes sense... or if it would keep moving horizontrally going towards the right making it where the user would have to scroll left and right instead of up and down to read the completed text. Yes my spelling isnt the best, yes this paragraph is even longer than the last one. Run ons are out of control.</p>
        <h4> Create a branch and then click the code you want to edit. Also are my headings getting smaller? </h4>
        <p> Was having a hard time figuring out how to edit the code after creating the branch and then realized I need to click on the code I want to edit.... OF COURSE! Also this is a test to see if my headers are getting smaller every time I add one.</p>
