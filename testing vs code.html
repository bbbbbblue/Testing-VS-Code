        <p> This is my 3rd attempt using vs code to get this test web page to work because TextEdit looks ugly on mac os and according to the internet VS Code is a good app to use to write code. </p>
        <h2>Why it took me three attempts to get my webpage to work</h2>
        <p>SOOO... everything with my code seemed fine, the problem was when I saved it and tried to open it in the browser the page was blank. While trouble shooting thew problem I solved it by clicking "save as", "document name.html", format= all file types. When I did that the "open edittor" drop down popped up with my file name and boom boom bam, my code open in the browser. Really not sure why buttttttttt it works.</p>
